# Want more?

Me, too! :) Some of the things that could help take Rails-i18n.org to the next level are:

## Solid tool recommendations

The site is meant to be a repository of both inspiration and tools. It would be very cool to have a dedicated Tool section, serving as an index for all of the various gems, Web services, and even vendors that make I18n a bit easier, or just better.

Have a tool recommendation to share? Talk to me (e at ezuk.org), or better yet, open a pull request on the [project page](https://github.com/ruby-i18n/rails-i18n.org).

## More interviews

Do you have an I18n mentor? Do you know someone inspiring who has wisdom and experience to share from years of internationalizing Rails applications? Let's interview them!

You can even interview yourself -- all developers get the same set of questions. Feel free to talk to me about somene you'd like me to approach, or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ruby-i18n/rails-i18n.org) with an interview.

## A slicker design

Do you have an eye for design, and wish this site looked a bit cooler? Awesome! Again - submit a pull request with some design tweaks, or talk to me. Whatever works for you. :)

## Your creativity!

Want to contribute to Rails-i18n.org in some other way? Please feel free! This is a community project, it's [open-source](https://github.com/ruby-i18n/rails-i18n.org), and I would love to collaborate with you.
